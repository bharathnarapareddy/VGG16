# VGG16 Model
VGG16 (also called OxfordNet) is a convolutional neural network architecture named after the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford, who developed it. It was used to win the ILSVR (ImageNet) competition in 2014. To this day is it still considered to be an excellent vision model, although it has been somewhat outperformed by more recent advances such as Inception and ResNet.
